In the previous [post](https://ramikrispin.github.io/2020/09/deploying-flexdashboard-on-github-pages/), I demonstrated how to deploy a flexdashboard dashboard (or basically, any R Markdown format) in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The focus of this post is on embedding flexdashboard oin pkgdown site. The **pkgdown** [package](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) is another great R Markdown format that enables us to quickly warp package information (documentation, vignettes, etc.) into a web format.

### Motivation

Why would you like to embed a flexdashboard dashboard in a pkgdown site? There are few reasons that I can think about, for example:

* Provide a summary and analysis of the package datasets
* Demonstrate the use case of the package functionality

My motivation for embedding flexdashboard into my pkgdown site was the first option above. A few weeks ago, while I was working on the [coronavirus](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) and [covid19italy](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/covid19Italy) packages, I created a dashboard for each package with flexdashboard ([Coronavirus](https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus_dashboard/) and [Covid19 Italy](https://ramikrispin.github.io/italy_dash/) dashboards). As flexdashboard is another R Markdown format, I was looking for a method to render flexdashboard as one of the package vignettes. That did not work (or render) as I expected, but I found a workaround for that by using the **HTML** `iframe` function.

### Embedding flexdashboard with iframe

The `iframe` function is an **HTML** for displaying a web page within a web page. To embed flexdashboard in pkgdown website, you will need:

* A deployed flexdashboard with access URL (see this post for instruction for deployment of flexdashboard on Github Pages)
* A rendered pkgdown

Once you have an end URL for the deployed flexdashboard dashboard (or generally any R Markdown format, Shiny app or any website), it is straightforward to deploy it by creating a dedicated vignette for embedding the dashboard as an article. The following example demonstrate step-by-step how to do it. We will start by creating a new vignette to host the dashboard. We will use the `use_vignette` function from the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package inside your package project:

``` r
usethis::use_vignette(name = "dashboard", title = "Your Dashboard Name")
```

This function created an R Markdown tembplate file named `dashboard.Rmd` inside the `vignettes` folder:

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("vignette1.Rmd"))
```

Next, we will edit the vignette template by removing the **R** code chunks with basic **HTML** code, setting `iframe` function:

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("vignette2.Rmd"))
```

The **HTML** code has two components, `style`, and `iframe`. As the name implies, the `style` component set the page style and layout (position, size, etc.). The current setting will display the dashboard in full size. In the `iframe` component, you simply need to set the flexdashboard URL address. 

Once rendering the pkgdown files with the `build_site` function, you should be able to view the dashboard under the article tab.

Here is an example for using this method for embedding the Covid19 Italy Dashboard on the covid19italy pkgdown website:

* Dashboard - https://ramikrispin.github.io/italy_dash/
* Vignette - https://github.com/RamiKrispin/covid19Italy/blob/master/vignettes/dashboard.Rmd
* Pkgdown website - https://ramikrispin.github.io/covid19Italy/articles/dashboard.html
